# Module One Final Project

For my mod 1 final project I built a Command Line movie database application.

## Installation 

Fork the repository and then in your terminal:<br> 
- type 'bundle install' and hit enter<br>
- type 'rake db:migrate' and hit enter<br>
- type 'rake db:seed' and hit enter<br>

After that, everything should be set up on your local machine and good to go!<br>

## Running this program

The run file is located in the bin folder.<br>
To run the program, go to your terminal and type 'ruby bin/run.rb' and hit enter.<br>

## How to navigate this program

Follow all the command prompts.<br>
The program is built to guide you through:<br>
- it will handle all user inputs<br>
- let you know if something was not valid<br>
- you can create a new user account<br>
- you can edit/update account information<br> 
- you can delete your account (this also deletes all of your movie ratings)<br>
- you can view all the movies in the database<br>
- you can search for movies by their title<br>
- you can add movies to the database<br>
- you can rate the movies in the database<br>
- you can find the average rating for each movie in the database<br>
